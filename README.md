# stn-placement

These are experiments designed to figure out whether it's reasonable to place a spatial transformer network (stn) anywhere inside a neural network.
Some experiments also test whether it's a good idea to share layers between the classification network and the localization network.

The transformer module in this code is taken from https://github.com/kevinzakka/spatial-transformer-network
